## Getting Started ðŸš€

    1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository_url]`
    2. Install dependencies: `pip install matplotlib`
    3. Run code: `streamlit run main.py`

    or 

### ðŸš€ Play [Demo](https://brandon-toews.github.io/drone-delivery/)
ðŸš§ **Allow a few seconds for UI to update after making selections or clicking buttons. DOES NOT RUN ON FIREFOX BROWSERS**

## Instuctions
### Graph Tab:

-   Use the sliders to configure graph dimensions.
-   Click the `Reset Graph` button to generate a new graph.

### A\* Tab:

-   Select a destination node and heuristic type.
-   Click `Perform A* Search` to run A\* algorithm.
-   Path is displayed in light blue with all explored paths colored in pink.

### Genetic Algorithm Tab:

-   Select number of drones available for deliveries, crossover type, and mutation rate.
-   Click `Randomly Select Destination Nodes` to generate random delivery goals with varying delivery urgencies.
-   Click `Perform Genetic Algorithm` to find the optimal paths and order of deliveries for each drone.
